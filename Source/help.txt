Burning Chicken

Just like the Burning Ship fractal,
this is just one step removed from the Mandelbrot set.

The control widgets all work the same way:
* Press and hold to either side of center to affect
  parameter(s) in specified direction and speed.
* Double Tap to toggle Fast versus Slow editing.
  (Red vs Green background color)

Note: Single tap on any widget to give it the FOCUS.
It will gain a red colored border.
Click and drag on the image to apply the movement to the widget.
The widgets' Fast vs Slow edit style affects the movements.

User 3DickUlus posted a beautiful image with the fragment shader attached.
I copied the algorithm onto this app to do some experimentation.

A. Coloring
   Toggle color method,  traditional color palette lookup, or average Coloring algorithm.

B. Chicken
   Render the normal Mandelbrot set, or the slightly altered code to produce the Burning Chicken fractal.

C. This group of widgets control the params to the Average Coloring algorithm.
   Check out Shaders.metal for their usage.

D. Move
   Scroll the image in X/Y.

E. Zoom
   Zoom into the fractal.

F. Save/Load
   Launch the Save/Load dialog.

G. Shadow
   Toggle whether shadowing effect is added

H. maxIterations
   Specify the number of interations the shader uses.
